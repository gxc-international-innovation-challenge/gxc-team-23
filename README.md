# gxc-team-23

Team 23 welcomes you to our GitHub page where you can look through our progress step by step in developing the ticket system application called Snow Activists. While cooperating with GXC International Virtual Innovation Challenge, the German Ski Federation requested us to build a place where all ski enthusiasts can get together. This App enables people to purchase any ticket related to snow activities - from making a reservation in a restaurant to ski rental reservations. Snow Activists helps make the overall experience excellent by tackling today's problem of scarce time, even when planning our leisure time. While people in Bavaria have a high interest in skiing and snow-related activities, the pain in waiting in the queue, unclear tariff lists, and lack of community prevent people from having an overall wholesome experience while skiing.

By installing Snow Activists and therefore put your time to perfect use with the possibility to buy your ticket efficiently one can individually plan on where to start your perfect winter season, including the help of like-minded people.
