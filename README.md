# About SnowActivist
Welcome to the repository of SnowActivist, the application that helps you purchasing tickets, avoiding the waiting lines and connecting with your friends on the slopes. We are a young start-up that emerged after a taking part in a student competition given by Hochschule MÃ¼nchen and DSV. The goal of this competition was  to create an innovative product that connects the different members of the winter sport community or solves a common problem. After some initial thought about potential issues that come with skiing, we figured that everything about tickets is a bit old fashioned. Our idea is explained in the Storyboard below:
